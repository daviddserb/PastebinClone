# Pastebin-Clone

Pastebin Clone is a web application that, as the name says, is a clone of the Pastebin website.
You can make blogs about what you want, where you can add a title and description to it. You also have a option to specify if you want it to be permanent or to be deleted after a period of time. For the deleting part, I made Database Trigger Events.
After the blog is posted, you can edit/delete it.

I used NodeJs, JavaScript, SQL for Database and HTML/CSS.
